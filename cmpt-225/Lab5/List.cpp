 * List.cpp - Implementation of the List class

 * Class Description: A value-oriented unsorted List data collection ADT class.
 *                    Note that this is a link-based implementation
 *                    of a List data collection ADT class.
 *                    Its underlying data structure is
 *                    a singly-headed singly-linked list (SHSL).

/* Generally, every class that makes use of dynamically allocated memory
 * should have at least two constructors:
 *   a default constructor and
 *   a copy constructor that creates a distinct copy of the given object
 * (even if the client code does not make use of all of these constructors).

/* Note that the compiler will generate a copy constructor automatically.
 * However, this constructor only creates a SHALLOW COPY (so would only copy the
 * elementCount and head variables). In this case, this would NOT CREATE A
 * NEW LIST object, just a new reference to "this" List object.
 * It is therefore necessary to write a constructor that makes a DEEP COPY
 * if our class makes use of dynamically allocated memory.
 */

/* Also note the parameter. C++ functions use pass-by-value by
 * default. This means that the functions make copies of the given
 * arguments. This is inefficient (particularly for large objects).
 * Therefore it is normal to pass the address, also called the reference,
 * (using &) of the parameter. Also, if the parameter must not be changed,
 * it is good practice to make it const, which prevents it from being changed.

		 * with "(*head).data" but the latter syntax is ugly and confusing and

 * a destructor. Destructors are identified by the '~' preceding the class name.
 * There can be only one destructor for a class, and it cannot have parameters.
