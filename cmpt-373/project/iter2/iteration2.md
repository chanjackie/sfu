# Iteration Peer and Peer Review

## Instructions

> This is a text based form that allows you to provide an easily analyzable
> data on how you feel that you and your teammates are doing on the project
> at this point. The form should be easy to fill out and provides evidence
> that can help me understand specific problem areas for groups and how to
> best remediate problems.
> 
> In some places, the form will indicate that you should enter text with
>   << TEXT YOU SHOULD ENTER >>
> In those locations, replace the text between and including the angle brackets
> with the specified text. for instance, I would replace
>   << SFU user ID >>
> with the text
>   wsumner
>
> In other places, the form will ask you to provide a ranking by deleting the
> rankings that do not apply. For instance, I make ask how well you agree with
> a statement on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongley agree).
> For instance, you may see:
>   Agreement: 1 2 3 4 5
> In such a case, delete the responsese you disagree with. For instance, if I
> stongly disagree, I would leave this text as:
>   Agreement: 1
>
> Similar rankings may occur for other issues in the form, as well.

## Free Form Comments

> What went well?

Similar to the first iteration, we continued to get along well with each other. Our bonds felt deeper through the shared struggles of the semester.
We also have a clearer idea of what needs to be done to progress the project.

> What went poorly?

We were fairly unproductive this iteration, as everyone seemed occupied by other responsibilities. We also met on our discord less frequently.

> Are there any other issues you have encountered or comments that you have so far?

Despite the lack of progress of our group (and assumably some other groups), Nick has remained very supportive and receptive to questions without 
being demeaning, which has really helped with motivation to continue trying my best despite how difficult the semester has been. Thank you Nick!
