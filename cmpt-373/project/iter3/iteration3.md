# Iteration Peer and Peer Review

## Instructions

> This is a text based form that allows you to provide an easily analyzable
> data on how you feel that you and your teammates are doing on the project
> at this point. The form should be easy to fill out and provides evidence
> that can help me understand specific problem areas for groups and how to
> best remediate problems.
> 
> In some places, the form will indicate that you should enter text with
>   << TEXT YOU SHOULD ENTER >>
> In those locations, replace the text between and including the angle brackets
> with the specified text. for instance, I would replace
>   << SFU user ID >>
> with the text
>   wsumner
>
> In other places, the form will ask you to provide a ranking by deleting the
> rankings that do not apply. For instance, I make ask how well you agree with
> a statement on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongley agree).
> For instance, you may see:
>   Agreement: 1 2 3 4 5
> In such a case, delete the responsese you disagree with. For instance, if I
> stongly disagree, I would leave this text as:
>   Agreement: 1
>
> Similar rankings may occur for other issues in the form, as well.

## Free Form Comments

> What went well?

We got better and communicating and deciding on the next steps to take for our project. Meetings felt more productive, although also much more scarce.

> What went poorly?

Personally this was my least productive iteration, and it felt like other group members were going through similar issues in terms of contributions to the project.

> Are there any other issues you have encountered or comments that you have so far?

Although the project didn't turn out the way we had hoped it would in the beginning, it was a great learning experience and it was fun working with my group members.
To be honest, at the start of the semester I dreaded attending the lectures because I felt all my weaknesses were being exposed, but as the semester progressed, each 
lecture felt more and more motivational rather than intimidating. By the end, I looked forward to getting an inspirational burst from each lecture, and overall I really 
enjoyed my time with this course, as it pushed me more than most other courses I've taken at SFU.
