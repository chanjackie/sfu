# Iteration Peer and Peer Review

## Instructions

> This is a text based form that allows you to provide an easily analyzable
> data on how you feel that you and your teammates are doing on the project
> at this point. The form should be easy to fill out and provides evidence
> that can help me understand specific problem areas for groups and how to
> best remediate problems.
> 
> In some places, the form will indicate that you should enter text with
>   << TEXT YOU SHOULD ENTER >>
> In those locations, replace the text between and including the angle brackets
> with the specified text. for instance, I would replace
>   << SFU user ID >>
> with the text
>   wsumner
>
> In other places, the form will ask you to provide a ranking by deleting the
> rankings that do not apply. For instance, I make ask how well you agree with
> a statement on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongley agree).
> For instance, you may see:
>   Agreement: 1 2 3 4 5
> In such a case, delete the responsese you disagree with. For instance, if I
> stongly disagree, I would leave this text as:
>   Agreement: 1
>
> Similar rankings may occur for other issues in the form, as well.

## Free Form Comments

> What went well?

We generally had very few conflicts or disagreements, and got along with each other fairly well.

> What went poorly?

We struggled to understand what first steps we needed to do, and generally were not very productive this iteration.
Many team meetings seemed to end with everyone still generally confused on what exactly to do.

> Are there any other issues you have encountered or comments that you have so far?

The lack of guidance in the first iteration has been difficult, but is a good learning experience. The intimidation 
factor of lectures has made it difficult to ask questions, as we felt our lack of progress would be painfully obvious
in the kinds of questions we wanted to ask.
