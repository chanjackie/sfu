I found the calculations with NumPy to be more intuitive to work with and easier to read. While the calculations made with 
Pandas and NumPy are extremely similar, the code utilizing NumPy calculations are easier read since the NumPy methods can be 
directly accessed from the np module.

The running time of the pivot_months_pandas function was 18.7 ms per loop, and the running time of the pivot_months_loops 
function was 579 ms per loop. This is likely due to the absence of loops and iteration in the pivot_months_pandas function, 
and the built in methods being much more efficient.
