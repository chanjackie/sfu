The result of the calculation is a pandas series containing the predicted rating at the timestamp of the tweet. Its type is float, and 
the values range between 10 and 15, steadily increasing as the timestamp increases.

This produces a fit line on the graph because the prediction is a linear relation between the timestamp and a predicted value. The 
created_at values and timestamp values pair correctly because the timestamp values are the created_at values converted to a numerical 
value, so each timestamp row in the dataframe corresponds to its datetime created_at value.
