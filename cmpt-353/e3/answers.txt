When smoothing the CPU temperature, I think I got a better result with LOESS smoothing. LOESS smoothing was able to capture the spikes
in temperature throughout the day and give a clearer picture of CPU temperature without being too noisy, while Kalman smoothing provided
similar information with a noiser representation.

The other variables could help with determining next latitude and longitude by affecting the transition matrices, and the transition
covariance matrix. If we had knowledge of the speed and direction at each timestamp, we would have much more useful transition 
matrices, which could give a much more accurate prediction of next latitude and longitude.
